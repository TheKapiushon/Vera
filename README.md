<h1>Hello Visitors, This is Kapiushon ✋🏼</h1>

### <i>Explanation<i/> 📄
<p>Well, this is my second official site that I design and build, I was hoping that I would be able to learn React and I did, and I even designed a site for myself using React as a resume and portfolio.</p>

<hr/>

### <i>Tools<i/> 🛠
<p>I tried to advance this project with the most up-to-date facilities and tools in the world of programming and front-end programming, and I used the following tools in it:</p>
    🔸 Tailwind <br/>
    🔸 React JS <br/>
    🔸 Vite

### <i>Future<i/> 🔮
<p>In the future, after completing Rocket, I will go to NextJS, I will not stop on the way of programming, Sadrasad Vera is not my last project, and I will definitely go further and further in the future.
I think of becoming a full-stack developer as a vision, but I move forward with small goals.</p>
